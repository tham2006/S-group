    <h1>This is still motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect the last guy's.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
    <h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3>
    <p>That's how much CSS it look to turn that <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read maste.It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li>Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>And guess what, motherfucker:</h4>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
    <h5 style="font-size: 1.15rem;">Let it breathe</h5>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    <h6 style="font-size: 1.15rem;">A little less contrast</h6>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    <h7><strong>Size Matters</strong></h7>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to rander close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
    <h8><strong>Line-width, motherfucker</strong></h8>
    <p>Looking at an LCD Screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <h9><strong>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</strong></h9>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a href="">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so,so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
